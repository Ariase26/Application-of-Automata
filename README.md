# Application of Automata Theorem by Jake R. Clarin - F2

**Program Details:**
- The attached C++ files above are a program that asks the user for a string input, and the program then checks whether that exact string follows the rule of starting with 'bb' and containing "ba" as a substring.
- If for instance, the inputted string does not abide by the rules, it would then be marked as invalid as it will check each character by moving from one state to another based on the state transition table below.
